# OxiSwap Asset Icons

This repository contains asset icons for the OxiSwap interface. It provides a standardized way to store and access asset logos for use in the OxiSwap ecosystem.

## Overview

The icons in this repository are used to visually represent various assets within the OxiSwap interface, enhancing user experience and asset recognition.

## File Structure and Naming Convention

- Each asset icon is stored in a separate folder under the `assets` directory.
- The folder name corresponds to the asset's contract address in lowercase.
- Inside each folder, the icon file should be named `logo.png`.
- 200x200 is the recommended size for the icon.

Example:

```
assets/
    0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/
